## Setup

Use Python 3.10 or newer.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Environment variables are read directly by the application. Load `.env` with your preferred shell/tool, or export values before running. The supported values are `APP_NAME`, `ENVIRONMENT`, `DATABASE_URL`, and `LOG_LEVEL`.

For the default SQLite URL, the database file is created at `data/learning_coach.db` when the API starts.

## Run the API

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` to receive a health response, and `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for the API documentation.

## Run the UI

In a second terminal with the virtual environment active:

```bash
streamlit run app/ui/streamlit_app.py
```

## Test

```bash
pytest
```

## Learner memory

The database persists learner profiles, a canonical skill catalog, per-learner
skill assessments, learning-topic progress, and portfolio projects. The
session-based CRUD functions live in `app/services/learner_memory_service.py`,
keeping this memory usable from future API and UI layers without coupling it to
an LLM.

## Learner onboarding, assessment, gap analysis, and roadmap generation

The Streamlit UI collects background, skill self-assessments, career goals, schedule, and learning preference. It validates required fields and feasible numeric values, persists one local onboarding profile, and shows an **Edit profile** action once it exists.

Module 3 covers 18 data-engineering skills on a 1–10 scale. It combines self-report with optional diagnostic, quiz, and project-evidence scores, then shows score, proficiency level, target gap, and priority. Self-report-only results are explicitly low confidence.

Module 4 builds an explainable target-role skill dependency graph from a learner profile, learner skills, target role, target timeline, and weekly study hours. It models prerequisite chains such as Python to PySpark to Spark Optimization, SQL to Data Modeling to Data Warehousing, Linux and Git to Docker to CI/CD, and ETL/ELT to Orchestration. The result reports skill gaps, readiness, blocked skills, critical gaps, estimated gap hours, and timeline capacity pressure, but it does not generate a roadmap.

Module 5 adds `generate_personalized_roadmap`, an LLM boundary that requires structured JSON/Pydantic output. The service accepts a learner profile, skill assessment, skill gap analysis, target role, timeline, and weekly study hours, then validates generated phases before callers can trust or persist them. Validation rejects free-form or malformed output, already-known topics, unsupported topics, prerequisite violations, timeline overruns, incorrect MUST_LEARN / GOOD_TO_LEARN / OPTIONAL labels, missing MUST_LEARN skills, and optional topics scheduled before required work. Tests use a mock LLM client, so no real API key is required.

Module 6 adds `generate_learning_plan`, a deterministic planner that converts a personalized roadmap into a weekly table with `Day`, `Topic`, `Activity`, `Duration`, and `Expected Outcome`, plus daily buckets for Learn, Practice, Hands-on, Revision, and Interview practice. The default allocation is 30% theory, 50% hands-on, and 20% interview/practice, and callers can override it with a validated `PlannerAllocation`. The planner skips completed topics unless revision is required, prioritizes weak topics during revision, and reschedules incomplete work while preserving important prerequisites without blindly shifting every future task.

Module 7 adds `handle_teaching_command`, a deterministic mentor-mode teaching engine for learner utterances such as "Teach me Spark", "Explain partitioning", "Give me today's task", "I don't understand joins", and "next topic". It maintains a `TeachingSession` with the current topic, learner level, current roadmap phase, completed/mastered topics, weak areas, and turn count. Each response follows the required flow: concept, simple explanation, data-engineering example, code/example, hands-on exercise, quiz, evaluation, and next step. Topic selection uses the roadmap, learning plan, weak areas, and mastered topics so beginner material that is already mastered is skipped or reframed instead of repeated.

Module 8 adds `get_quiz`, `evaluate_learner_answer`, and `submit_quiz_answer` for Python, SQL, ETL, Spark, Cloud, Data Warehousing, Orchestration, and System Design quizzes at Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced levels. Each question stores its question text, topic, difficulty, and expected concepts. Answer evaluation uses an injectable structured-output LLM boundary and returns score / 10, correct points, missing points, mistakes, an improved answer, and a recommended action. Quiz attempts are persisted as learner evidence; proficiency updates use multiple observations and bounded score movement so one strong answer does not significantly increase a skill level.

Module 9 adds `get_progress_dashboard`, a learner-state dashboard aggregator for roadmap completion, phase completion, topic completion, quiz scores, skill improvement, project progress, study streak, weak areas, recent quiz performance, and a "What should I do next?" recommendation. Recommendations are derived from tracked learner state, prioritizing low recent quiz scores, active topics, weak skills, incomplete topics, and active projects. The Streamlit UI renders the dashboard once an onboarding profile exists.

Module 10 adds `recommend_projects` and `review_project`. The recommendation engine creates Level 1 Beginner, Level 2 Intermediate, Level 3 Advanced, and Level 4 Production-style project blueprints from learner level, roadmap phase, target role, learned technologies, and missing skills. Each blueprint includes business problem, data source, architecture, technologies, schema, data flow, ETL steps, data quality checks, error handling, orchestration, monitoring, deployment, GitHub structure, resume bullets, and interview explanation. Review mode scores submitted projects across architecture, scalability, performance, data quality, security, cost, monitoring, error handling, and maintainability, then returns priority improvements and interview guidance. API endpoints are available at `POST /projects/recommendations` and `POST /projects/review`.

Module 11 adds `get_interview_question`, `submit_interview_answer`, and `get_interview_report` for a Data Engineering Interview Agent. It supports SQL, Python, Spark, AWS, Azure, ETL, Data Warehousing, System Design, and Scenario-based interview modes at Junior, Mid-level, and Senior difficulty. Each answer follows the interview flow of question, learner answer, evaluation, score / 10, missing concepts, improved interview answer, and a follow-up question that depends on the learner's previous answer. Interview attempts are persisted and reports summarize strengths, weaknesses, topics to revise, average score, and recommended next topics. API endpoints are available at `POST /interviews/questions`, `POST /interviews/answers`, and `GET /interviews/report/{learner_id}`.

Module 12 adds a standalone learning-resource catalog and deterministic recommendations. Resource records and Pydantic schemas cover title, URL, type, topic, difficulty, source, and description. Recommendations return up to three topic-matched resources, preferring higher-quality resource types and levels close to the learner's level. The Streamlit resource renderer displays the recommendations and a clear empty state for unknown topics.

Module 13 adds adaptive learning decisions. The priority calculator combines skill gap, role relevance, prerequisite importance, and timeline risk, while the next-best-action engine selects one learner action such as learning a topic, practicing, revising, building a project, or moving to the next phase. It respects completed topics, repeated quiz difficulty, missing prerequisites, and schedule risk; the integration tests cover persisted progress and prerequisite-aware recommendations.

Module 14 adds a deterministic learning-coach agent boundary with intent definitions, keyword routing, and a thin orchestrator. It dispatches learning and practice requests to mentor mode, quiz and interview requests to their question services, resource requests to local recommendations, and next-action requests to the adaptive engine. Roadmap, progress, and project-review intents are represented and returned as structured not-connected responses until learner context is wired into those agent paths.

Module 15 adds a learner-facing dashboard renderer for the Streamlit application. It presents overall progress, current phase, today's task, the next best action, and current skill gaps, including empty states when tracked data is unavailable. The renderer reuses the existing progress aggregation service and can receive the in-session personalized roadmap.

Module 16 adds Gemini-backed personalized roadmap generation through the official `google-genai` SDK. The client loads the configured Gemini model and API key lazily, requests structured JSON using a Gemini-compatible copy of the Pydantic schema, and validates the returned data against `PersonalizedRoadmap` before the existing roadmap validator accepts it. The Streamlit Roadmap page uses this client while preserving the existing learner lookup and session-state flow.

Module 17 hardens roadmap generation and diagnostics. Gemini transient provider failures use bounded exponential retries, while permanent errors and schema failures are not retried. Roadmap errors and validation failures are propagated to the UI with sanitized diagnostics and validation details, without exposing credentials, request contents, or provider responses.
